# Register a Group

This how-to will take you through the steps of registering a [Group](../explanations/group.md) with the developer portal. Groups are registed via a central [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.diamond.ac.uk/sscc-docs/groups). The instructions provided in the `README.md` file of this repository should be followed to perform group registration.
