# Component Annotations

The following annotations are supported for components:

- `github.com/project-slug` - This should be set to the project slug of a component hosted on GitHub, e.g. `DiamondLightSource/developer-portal`, and will allow the [GitHub Actions plugin](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/github-actions) to ingress the CI/CD pipeline status of your component.
