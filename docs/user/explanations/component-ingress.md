# Component Ingress

The diamond developer portal is configured such that component ingress must be performed via discovery, allowing it to act as a transparent window onto the software and services currently developed and deployed at Diamond.

As a consequence of this, for a component to become available in the catalogue, an entity descriptor (commonly a `catalog-info.yaml` file) must be be made available in one of the [discovery locations](../references/discovery-locations.md).
