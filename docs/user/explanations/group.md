# Groups

A group describes an organizational entity, such as for example a team, a business unit, or a loose collection of people in an interest group. Members of these groups are modeled in the catalog as kind [User](user.md).

Group entities should not be defined by developer portal users, instead they will be automatically ingressed from one of the [entity ingress](entity-ingress.md) locations.
