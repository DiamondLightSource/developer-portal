# Get a Repository

To begin, you will need to create or clone a repository in or from one of the Git discovery locations, such that they are available to [entity ingress](../explanations/entity-ingress.md).

!!! info "Discovery Locations"

    {%
        include-markdown "../references/discovery-locations.md"
        start="<!--start-git-locations-->"
        end="<!--end-git-locations-->"
    %}
