An [entity reference](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/references#string-references) to the owner of the entity, e.g. `owner: user:enu43627`.

The owner of an entity is the `group` or `user` that bears ultimate responsibility for the entity, and has the authority and capability to develop and maintain it. They will be the point of contact if something goes wrong, or if features are to be requested. The main purpose of this field is for display purposes in Backstage, so that people looking at catalog items can get an understanding of to whom this entity belongs. It is not to be used by automated processes to for example assign authorization in runtime systems. There may be others that also develop or otherwise touch the entity, but there will always be one ultimate owner.
