# Debug Entity Descriptors

Whilst the catalog is configured in read-only mode, the Create Component tools can be useful in helping you quickly draft entity descriptors or to debug ones which are not working.

To debug an existing entity descriptor, simply navigate to the `Register an Existing Component` screen by following `Catalog` > `Create` > "Register Existing Component".

Once on this screen you may enter the fully qualified URL (e.g. `https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/developer-portal/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml`) to a misbehaving entity descriptor, and press `Analyze`. If an error exists with the entity descriptor it will be displayed at this point.
