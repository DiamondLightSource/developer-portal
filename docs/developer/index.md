# Developer Guide Home

The Developer Guide contains documentation on how to develop and contribute changes back to the developer portal. This is split into four sub-sections:

- [**Tutorials** :link:](tutorials/index.md) provide worked examples of some relevent tasks.

- [**How-Tos** :link:](how-tos/index.md) provide step-by-step guides for day-to-day tasks.

- [**Explanations** :link:](explanations/index.md) provide insight into how and why the architecture is the way it is.

- [**References** :link:](references/index.md) provide technical reference material on the standards in use.
