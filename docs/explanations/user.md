# Users

A user describes a person, such as an employee, a contractor, or similar. Users belong to [Group](group.md) entities in the catalog.

User entities should not be defined by developer portal users, instead they will be automatically ingressed from one of the [entity ingress](entity-ingress.md) locations.
