The API can be defined in different formats, like OpenAPI , AsyncAPI , GraphQL , gRPC , or other formats. See common api types for an exhaustive list of supported formats. Definition \u00b6 Backstage Docs See the backstage docs for a full description of the API entity definition. As with all other entities, an API consists of the envelope types, apiVersion and kind , as well as generic metadata and a specific spec . apiVersion [Required] \u00b6 The apiVersion is the version of specification format for that particular entity that the specification is made against. The version is used for being able to evolve the format and to distinguish them from other types of object that share the same type of structure - e.g. Kubernetes object manifests. At present all entity descriptors should be given an apiVersion of backstage.io/v1alpha1 . This will change as backstage develops or if we choose to add custom entity kind s to the portal. kind [Required] \u00b6 The kind is the high level entity type being described. For an API this must be API , e.g. kind: API . Other available kind s are enumerated in the entity types reference . metadata [Required] \u00b6 A structure that contains metadata about the entity, i.e. things that aren't directly part of the entity specification itself. See the entity metadata reference for more details about this structure. name [Required] \u00b6 The name of the entity. This name is both meant for human eyes to recognize the entity, and for machines and other components to reference the entity, e.g. visits-tracking-service Names must be unique per kind, at any point in time. This uniqueness constraint is case insensitive. Names may be reused at a later time, after an entity is deleted from the registry. Names are required to follow a certain format. Entities that do not follow those rules will not be accepted for registration in the catalog. The required format is as follows: Strings of length at least 1, and at most 63 Must consist of sequences of [a-z0-9A-Z] possibly separated by one of [-_.] title [Optional] \u00b6 A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the name property above, when available. This field is sometimes useful when the name is cumbersome or ends up being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another entity, or where two entities share a title. Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the name property for example, not the title. description [Optional] \u00b6 A human readable description of the entity, to be shown in the developer portal. Should be kept short and informative, suitable to give an overview of the entity's purpose at a glance. More detailed explanations and documentation should be placed elsewhere. labels [Optional] \u00b6 Labels are optional key/value pairs of that are attached to the entity, and their use is identical to Kubernetes object labels . Their main purpose is for references to other entities, and for information that is in one way or another classifying for the current entity. They are often used as values in queries or filters. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix, if present, must be a valid lowercase domain name, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values are strings that follow the same restrictions as name above. annotations [Optional] \u00b6 An object with arbitrary non-identifying metadata attached to the entity, identical in use to Kubernetes object annotations . Their purpose is mainly, but not limited, to reference into external systems. This could for example be a reference to the git ref the entity was ingested from, to monitoring and logging systems, to PagerDuty schedules, etc. Users may add these to descriptor YAML files, but in addition to this automated systems may also add annotations, either during ingestion into the catalog, or at a later time. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix must be a valid lowercase domain name if specified, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values can be of any length, but are limited to being strings. tags [Optional] \u00b6 A list of single-valued strings, for example to classify catalog entities in various ways. This is different to the labels in metadata, as labels are key-value pairs. The values are user defined, for example the programming language used for the component, like java or go. This field is optional, and currently has no special semantics. Each tag must be sequences of [a-z0-9] separated by - , at most 63 characters in total. links [Optional] \u00b6 A list of external hyperlinks related to the entity. Links can provide additional contextual information that may be located outside of the developer portal itself. For example, an admin dashboard or external CMS page. Users may add links to descriptor YAML files to provide additional reference information to external content & resources. Links are not intended to drive any additional functionality within Backstage, which is best left to annotations and labels. It is recommended to use links only when an equivalent well-known annotation does not cover a similar use case. Fields of a link are: url [Required] \u00b6 A url in a standard uri format, e.g. url: https://example.com/some/page title [Optioanl] \u00b6 A user friendly display name for the link, e.g. title: Example Website icon [Optional] \u00b6 A key representing a visual icon to be displayed in the UI, e.g. icon: docs The icon field value is meant to be a semantic key that will map to a specific icon that may be provided by an icon library (e.g. material-ui icons). These keys should be a sequence of [a-z0-9A-Z] , possibly separated by one of [-_.] . The default backstage icon-component mappings are used, see the app-defaults for details. A generic fallback icon would be provided if a mapping cannot be resolved. spec [Required] \u00b6 The actual specification data that describes the entity. type [Required] \u00b6 The type of API as a string, e.g. type: openapi . Whilst the spec.type of a API may be any string, visualisation is only available for a small subset. Further to this, understanding is made easier by sticking to a small set of well-known and common values. Thus we recommend that when specifying an API one of the following is used in this field: openapi - an API definition in YAML or JSON format based on the OpenAPI version 2 or version 3 spec asyncapi - an API definition based on the AsyncAPI spec graphql - an API definition based on GraphQL schemas for consuming GraphQL based APIs grpc - an API definition based on Protocol Buffers to use with gRPC lifecycle [Required] \u00b6 The lifecycle state of the API as a string, e.g. lifecycle: production . Whilst the spec.type of a Component or API may be any string, understanding is made easier by sticking to a small set of well-known and common values. Thus we recommend that when specifying an entity one of the following is used in this field: experimental - an experiment or early, non-production entity, signaling that users may not prefer to consume it over other more established entities, or that there are low or no reliability guarantees production - an established, owned, maintained entity deprecated - an entity that is at the end of its lifecycle, and may disappear at a later point in time owner [Required] \u00b6 An entity reference to the owner of the entity, e.g. owner: user:enu43627 . Users and Groups are automatically populated, and can listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of User or Group respectively. The owner of an entity is the group or user that bears ultimate responsibility for the entity, and has the authority and capability to develop and maintain it. They will be the point of contact if something goes wrong, or if features are to be requested.

It is not to be used by automated processes to for example assign authorization in runtime systems. There may be others that also develop or otherwise touch the entity, but there will always be one ultimate owner. system [Optional] \u00b6 An entity reference to the System that the entity belongs to, e.g. developer-portal . There is no requirement for this System to be created within the same location; Existing Systems can be listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of System . definition [Required] \u00b6 The definition of the API, as a multi-line string, based on the format defined by type . For example, where type is openapi : 1 2 3 4 5 definition : | openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: Backstage API version: 0.0.1 Tip The API schema can be located in another file and imported by using substitutions, e.g.: 1 2 definition : $text : ./schema-file.json $text , $json & $yaml are available, for more details see the backstage docs","title":"APIs"},{"location":"user/explanations/api/#apis","text":"","title":"APIs"},{"location":"user/explanations/api/#summary","text":"An API describes an interface that can be exposed by a component.

Entity references still always make use of the name property for example, not the title. description [Optional] \u00b6 A human readable description of the entity, to be shown in the developer portal. Should be kept short and informative, suitable to give an overview of the entity's purpose at a glance. More detailed explanations and documentation should be placed elsewhere. labels [Optional] \u00b6 Labels are optional key/value pairs of that are attached to the entity, and their use is identical to Kubernetes object labels . Their main purpose is for references to other entities, and for information that is in one way or another classifying for the current entity. They are often used as values in queries or filters. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix, if present, must be a valid lowercase domain name, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values are strings that follow the same restrictions as name above. annotations [Optional] \u00b6 An object with arbitrary non-identifying metadata attached to the entity, identical in use to Kubernetes object annotations . Their purpose is mainly, but not limited, to reference into external systems. This could for example be a reference to the git ref the entity was ingested from, to monitoring and logging systems, to PagerDuty schedules, etc. Users may add these to descriptor YAML files, but in addition to this automated systems may also add annotations, either during ingestion into the catalog, or at a later time. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix must be a valid lowercase domain name if specified, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values can be of any length, but are limited to being strings. tags [Optional] \u00b6 A list of single-valued strings, for example to classify catalog entities in various ways. This is different to the labels in metadata, as labels are key-value pairs. The values are user defined, for example the programming language used for the component, like java or go. This field is optional, and currently has no special semantics. Each tag must be sequences of [a-z0-9] separated by - , at most 63 characters in total. links [Optional] \u00b6 A list of external hyperlinks related to the entity. Links can provide additional contextual information that may be located outside of the developer portal itself. For example, an admin dashboard or external CMS page. Users may add links to descriptor YAML files to provide additional reference information to external content & resources. Links are not intended to drive any additional functionality within Backstage, which is best left to annotations and labels. It is recommended to use links only when an equivalent well-known annotation does not cover a similar use case. Fields of a link are: url [Required] \u00b6 A url in a standard uri format, e.g. url: https://example.com/some/page title [Optioanl] \u00b6 A user friendly display name for the link, e.g. title: Example Website icon [Optional] \u00b6 A key representing a visual icon to be displayed in the UI, e.g. icon: docs The icon field value is meant to be a semantic key that will map to a specific icon that may be provided by an icon library (e.g. material-ui icons). These keys should be a sequence of [a-z0-9A-Z] , possibly separated by one of [-_.] . The default backstage icon-component mappings are used, see the app-defaults for details. A generic fallback icon would be provided if a mapping cannot be resolved. spec [Required] \u00b6 The actual specification data that describes the entity. type [Required] \u00b6 The type of Component as a string, e.g. type: service . Whilst the type of a Component may be any string, it is strongly recommended that you use one of the common values. Futher to this, tools including Backstage itself may read this field and behave differently depending on its value. For example, a website type component may present tooling in the Backstage interface that is specific to just websites. Thus we recommend that when specifying a component one of the following is used in this field: library - a software library service - a backend service, typically exposing an API user-interface - a local user interface website - a web user interface lifecycle [Required] \u00b6 The lifecycle state of the Component as a string, e.g. lifecycle: production . Whilst the spec.type of a Component or API may be any string, understanding is made easier by sticking to a small set of well-known and common values. Thus we recommend that when specifying an entity one of the following is used in this field: experimental - an experiment or early, non-production entity, signaling that users may not prefer to consume it over other more established entities, or that there are low or no reliability guarantees production - an established, owned, maintained entity deprecated - an entity that is at the end of its lifecycle, and may disappear at a later point in time owner [Required] \u00b6 An entity reference to the owner of the entity, e.g. owner: user:enu43627 . Users and Groups are automatically populated, and can listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of User or Group respectively. The owner of an entity is the group or user that bears ultimate responsibility for the entity, and has the authority and capability to develop and maintain it. They will be the point of contact if something goes wrong, or if features are to be requested. The main purpose of this field is for display purposes in Backstage, so that people looking at catalog items can get an understanding of to whom this entity belongs. It is not to be used by automated processes to for example assign authorization in runtime systems. There may be others that also develop or otherwise touch the entity, but there will always be one ultimate owner. system [Optional] \u00b6 An entity reference to the System that the entity belongs to, e.g. developer-portal . There is no requirement for this System to be created within the same location; Existing Systems can be listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of System . subcomponentOf [Optional] \u00b6 An entity reference to another Component of which this Component is part of, e.g. subComponentOf: developer-portal-frontend . There is no requirement for this Component to be created within the same location; Existing Components can be listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of Component . providesApis [Optional] \u00b6 An array of entity references to the APIs that are provided by the Component, e.g. providesApis: [developer-portal-backend-rest] . There is no requirement for these APIs to be created within the same location; Existing APIs can be listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of API . consumesApis [Optional] \u00b6 An array of entity references to the APIs that are consumed by the Component, e.g. consumesApis: [developer-portal-backend-rest] . There is no requirement for these APIs to be created within the same location; Existing APIs can be listed in the catalog by filtering by Kind of API . dependsOn [Optional] \u00b6 An array of entity references to the Components and Resources that this entity depends on, e.g. dependsOn: [component:developer-portal-backend] . There is no requirement for these entities to be created within the same location; Existing entities can be listed in the catalog.","title":"Components"},{"location":"user/explanations/component/#components","text":"","title":"Components"},{"location":"user/explanations/component/#summary","text":"A Component describes a software component.

At present all entity descriptors should be given an apiVersion of backstage.io/v1alpha1 . This will change as backstage develops or if we choose to add custom entity kind s to the portal. kind [Required] \u00b6 The kind is the high level entity type being described. For an entity location this must be Location , e.g. kind: Location . Other available kind s are enumerated in the entity types reference . metadata [Required] \u00b6 A structure that contains metadata about the entity, i.e. things that aren't directly part of the entity specification itself. See the entity metadata reference for more details about this structure. name [Required] \u00b6 The name of the entity. This name is both meant for human eyes to recognize the entity, and for machines and other components to reference the entity, e.g. visits-tracking-service Names must be unique per kind, at any point in time. This uniqueness constraint is case insensitive. Names may be reused at a later time, after an entity is deleted from the registry. Names are required to follow a certain format. Entities that do not follow those rules will not be accepted for registration in the catalog. The required format is as follows: Strings of length at least 1, and at most 63 Must consist of sequences of [a-z0-9A-Z] possibly separated by one of [-_.] title [Optional] \u00b6 A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the name property above, when available. This field is sometimes useful when the name is cumbersome or ends up being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another entity, or where two entities share a title. Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the name property for example, not the title. description [Optional] \u00b6 A human readable description of the entity, to be shown in the developer portal. Should be kept short and informative, suitable to give an overview of the entity's purpose at a glance. More detailed explanations and documentation should be placed elsewhere. labels [Optional] \u00b6 Labels are optional key/value pairs of that are attached to the entity, and their use is identical to Kubernetes object labels . Their main purpose is for references to other entities, and for information that is in one way or another classifying for the current entity. They are often used as values in queries or filters. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix, if present, must be a valid lowercase domain name, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values are strings that follow the same restrictions as name above. annotations [Optional] \u00b6 An object with arbitrary non-identifying metadata attached to the entity, identical in use to Kubernetes object annotations . Their purpose is mainly, but not limited, to reference into external systems. This could for example be a reference to the git ref the entity was ingested from, to monitoring and logging systems, to PagerDuty schedules, etc. Users may add these to descriptor YAML files, but in addition to this automated systems may also add annotations, either during ingestion into the catalog, or at a later time.

This is different to the labels in metadata, as labels are key-value pairs. The values are user defined, for example the programming language used for the component, like java or go. This field is optional, and currently has no special semantics. Each tag must be sequences of [a-z0-9] separated by - , at most 63 characters in total. links [Optional] \u00b6 A list of external hyperlinks related to the entity. Links can provide additional contextual information that may be located outside of the developer portal itself. For example, an admin dashboard or external CMS page. Users may add links to descriptor YAML files to provide additional reference information to external content & resources. Links are not intended to drive any additional functionality within Backstage, which is best left to annotations and labels. It is recommended to use links only when an equivalent well-known annotation does not cover a similar use case. Fields of a link are: url [Required] \u00b6 A url in a standard uri format, e.g. url: https://example.com/some/page title [Optioanl] \u00b6 A user friendly display name for the link, e.g. title: Example Website icon [Optional] \u00b6 A key representing a visual icon to be displayed in the UI, e.g. icon: docs The icon field value is meant to be a semantic key that will map to a specific icon that may be provided by an icon library (e.g. material-ui icons). These keys should be a sequence of [a-z0-9A-Z] , possibly separated by one of [-_.] . The default backstage icon-component mappings are used, see the app-defaults for details. A generic fallback icon would be provided if a mapping cannot be resolved. spec [Required] \u00b6 The actual specification data that describes the entity. type [Optional] \u00b6 The single location type, that's common to the targets specified in the spec.

This also gives the owning team the possibility to decide about published artifacts and APIs. Definition \u00b6 Backstage Docs See the backstage docs for a full description of the System entity definition. As with all other entities, a system consists of the envelope types, apiVersion and kind , as well as generic metadata and a specific spec . apiVersion [Required] \u00b6 The apiVersion is the version of specification format for that particular entity that the specification is made against. The version is used for being able to evolve the format and to distinguish them from other types of object that share the same type of structure - e.g. Kubernetes object manifests. At present all entity descriptors should be given an apiVersion of backstage.io/v1alpha1 . This will change as backstage develops or if we choose to add custom entity kind s to the portal. kind [Required] \u00b6 The kind is the high level entity type being described. For a software system this must be System , e.g. kind: System . Other available kind s are enumerated in the entity types reference . metadata [Required] \u00b6 A structure that contains metadata about the entity, i.e. things that aren't directly part of the entity specification itself. See the entity metadata reference for more details about this structure. name [Required] \u00b6 The name of the entity. This name is both meant for human eyes to recognize the entity, and for machines and other components to reference the entity, e.g. visits-tracking-service Names must be unique per kind, at any point in time. This uniqueness constraint is case insensitive. Names may be reused at a later time, after an entity is deleted from the registry. Names are required to follow a certain format. Entities that do not follow those rules will not be accepted for registration in the catalog. The required format is as follows: Strings of length at least 1, and at most 63 Must consist of sequences of [a-z0-9A-Z] possibly separated by one of [-_.] title [Optional] \u00b6 A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the name property above, when available. This field is sometimes useful when the name is cumbersome or ends up being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another entity, or where two entities share a title. Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the name property for example, not the title. description [Optional] \u00b6 A human readable description of the entity, to be shown in the developer portal. Should be kept short and informative, suitable to give an overview of the entity's purpose at a glance. More detailed explanations and documentation should be placed elsewhere. labels [Optional] \u00b6 Labels are optional key/value pairs of that are attached to the entity, and their use is identical to Kubernetes object labels . Their main purpose is for references to other entities, and for information that is in one way or another classifying for the current entity. They are often used as values in queries or filters. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix, if present, must be a valid lowercase domain name, at most 253 characters in total.

Values are strings that follow the same restrictions as name above. annotations [Optional] \u00b6 An object with arbitrary non-identifying metadata attached to the entity, identical in use to Kubernetes object annotations . Their purpose is mainly, but not limited, to reference into external systems. This could for example be a reference to the git ref the entity was ingested from, to monitoring and logging systems, to PagerDuty schedules, etc. Users may add these to descriptor YAML files, but in addition to this automated systems may also add annotations, either during ingestion into the catalog, or at a later time.

This field is optional, and currently has no special semantics.

Get a Repository \u00b6 To begin, you will need to create or clone a repository in or from one of the Git discovery locations, such that they are available to entity ingress . Discovery Locations github.com/DiamondLightSource Entity descriptors at /catalog-info.yaml gitlab.diamond.ac.uk Entity descriptors at /catalog-info.yaml Create Referenced Descriptors \u00b6 It is nessacary to create a number of regular entities (e.g. Components or APIs ) before we can register them together. This may be performed as explained in Register a Component or Register a Static API . Instead of their usual locations, these files should be given names and located in directories appropriate to the entity they register. For example, the entity descriptor for my-component may be located at my-component/catalog-info.yaml or catalog-info/my-component.yaml . Create an Entity Descriptor \u00b6 Firstly, we must create the entity descriptor file, please reference the Discovery Locations above for the appropriate location - this is typically catalog-info.yaml at the root of the repository. To begin, we will specify the apiVersion to be backstage.io/v1alpha1 and the kind as Location . E.g.: Entity Definition \u00b6 Example 1 2 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : Location Metadata \u00b6 Next, we will fill out the metadata , this is common to all entity types. Only the name field is required with numerous other optional fields available. It is recommended that you enter a title and a description . Complete field descriptions are available in the metadata reference . Example 1 2 3 4 metadata : name : developer-portal title : Developer Portal description : The diamond developer portal. Location Spec \u00b6 Finally, we will fill out the spec . Only the targets field is required with numerous other optional fields available.

In addition to these, you may add any number of other fields directly under metadata, but be aware that general plugins and tools may not be able to understand their semantics. See Extending the model for more information. name [Required] \u00b6 The name of the entity. This name is both meant for human eyes to recognize the entity, and for machines and other components to reference the entity, e.g. visits-tracking-service Names must be unique per kind, at any point in time. This uniqueness constraint is case insensitive. Names may be reused at a later time, after an entity is deleted from the registry. Names are required to follow a certain format. Entities that do not follow those rules will not be accepted for registration in the catalog. The required format is as follows: Strings of length at least 1, and at most 63 Must consist of sequences of [a-z0-9A-Z] possibly separated by one of [-_.] title [Optional] \u00b6 A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the name property above, when available. This field is sometimes useful when the name is cumbersome or ends up being perceived as overly technical. The title generally does not have as stringent format requirements on it, so it may contain special characters and be more explanatory. Do keep it very short though, and avoid situations where a title can be confused with the name of another entity, or where two entities share a title. Note that this is only for display purposes, and may be ignored by some parts of the code. Entity references still always make use of the name property for example, not the title. description [Optional] \u00b6 A human readable description of the entity, to be shown in the developer portal. Should be kept short and informative, suitable to give an overview of the entity's purpose at a glance. More detailed explanations and documentation should be placed elsewhere. labels [Optional] \u00b6 Labels are optional key/value pairs of that are attached to the entity, and their use is identical to Kubernetes object labels . Their main purpose is for references to other entities, and for information that is in one way or another classifying for the current entity. They are often used as values in queries or filters. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix, if present, must be a valid lowercase domain name, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values are strings that follow the same restrictions as name above. annotations [Optional] \u00b6 An object with arbitrary non-identifying metadata attached to the entity, identical in use to Kubernetes object annotations . Their purpose is mainly, but not limited, to reference into external systems. This could for example be a reference to the git ref the entity was ingested from, to monitoring and logging systems, to PagerDuty schedules, etc. Users may add these to descriptor YAML files, but in addition to this automated systems may also add annotations, either during ingestion into the catalog, or at a later time. Both the key and the value are strings, subject to the following restrictions. Keys have an optional prefix followed by a slash, and then the name part which is required. The prefix must be a valid lowercase domain name if specified, at most 253 characters in total. The name part must be sequences of [a-zA-Z0-9] separated by any of [-_.] , at most 63 characters in total. The backstage.io/ prefix is reserved for use by Backstage core components. Values can be of any length, but are limited to being strings. tags [Optional] \u00b6 A list of single-valued strings, for example to classify catalog entities in various ways. This is different to the labels in metadata, as labels are key-value pairs. The values are user defined, for example the programming language used for the component, like java or go. This field is optional, and currently has no special semantics. Each tag must be sequences of [a-z0-9] separated by - , at most 63 characters in total. links [Optional] \u00b6 A list of external hyperlinks related to the entity. Links can provide additional contextual information that may be located outside of the developer portal itself. For example, an admin dashboard or external CMS page. Users may add links to descriptor YAML files to provide additional reference information to external content & resources.

This app will comprise of four entities: A Component for the Backend A Component for the Frontend An API produced by the Backend and consumed by the Frontend A System which encompasses the whole app Create a Git Repository \u00b6 To begin, we will create a new git repository. To do this we will: Create a new directory with mkdir Change into this new directory with cd Intialize git with git init Let's call our web app my-web-app , thus in a new bash terminal we will execute the following: 1 2 3 mkdir my-web-app cd my-web-app git init Create the Entity Descriptor File \u00b6 We will begin by creating the entity descriptor file, in which all of the entity definitions will be placed. This file will be indexed by the developer portal entity ingress process , thus it must be in the exact location defined for the Git discovery locations . Discovery Locations github.com/DiamondLightSource Entity descriptors at /catalog-info.yaml gitlab.diamond.ac.uk Entity descriptors at /catalog-info.yaml 1 touch catalog-info.yaml With our favourite text editor we will then open this file and begin filling it out. The nano editor is considered rather beginner friendly, thus we will choose to use it. You can open the file we just created by executing: 1 nano system-info.yaml Create the System \u00b6 The first entity we will create is a System , this will encompass the whole app. The following contents should be entered into the catalog-info,yaml file. System Entity Definition \u00b6 Info A full description of the top level structure of an entity definition can be found in the entity envelope reference . Each entity definition must include an apiVersion and a kind . The apiVersion is used to track the version of the entity definition format that is being used, the current version is backstage.io/v1alpha1 thus we will use this. The kind is used to specify the type of entity we are defining, for a software system we use System . Thus we will begin the definition with the following: 1 2 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : System System Metadata \u00b6 Info A full list of entity metadata fields can be found in the entity metadata reference . Each entity must be given some metadata, this is the same regardless of the entity kind , and will reside within the metadata object. Only a name is required, however we will choose to give the system a title and description as well. The name should be both human and machine readable, this it is required to be a globally unique string between 1 and 63 characters consisting of sequences of [a-z0-9A-Z] possibly separated by one of [-_.] , we will choose to call our system my-web-app . The title field is less restrictive, it should simply be a short human readable string, we will title our System My Web App . The description is similar, but should be longer, we will use it to briefly describe what our system is. Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 metadata : name : my-web-app title : My Web App description : A web application created by me, consisting of a backend and frontend connected by a REST API System Spec \u00b6 Info A full list of system spec fields can be found in the system spec reference . Each entity must be given a spec, this is unique to each entity kind , and will reside within the spec object. For a System, only an owner is required, in this tutorial I will reference myself, user:enu43627 , whilst you should use your own FedID in place of mine ( enu43627 ). 1 2 spec : owner : user:enu43627 Complete System Definition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : System metadata : name : my-web-app title : My Web App description : A web application created by me, consisting of a backend and frontend connected by a REST API spec : owner : user:enu43627 Create the Backend Component \u00b6 We will now create a Component for the Backend. We will append the following Component definition to the previous definition, with three dashes ( --- ) seperating them. Backend Component Entity Definition \u00b6 For a Component we must define the entity kind to be component . Thus we will begin the definition with the following: 1 2 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : component Backend Component Metadata \u00b6 We will name our backend component a my-web-app-backend , give it the title My Web App Backend and an description which will briefly describe what our component does. Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 metadata : name : my-web-app-backend title : My Web App Backend description : The backend service for My Web App, it provides an API with lots of useful data Backend Component Spec \u00b6 Info A full list of component spec fields can be found in the component spec reference . Each entity must be given a spec, this is unique to each entity kind , and will reside within the spec object. For a Component, a type , lifecycle , and owner are required, in addition to these we will define system and providesApis . Whilst type may be any string there are a small number of commonly used values which should be used, we will choose service to describe our Backend. The lifecycle may also be any string, but again there are a small number of commonly used values which should be used, we will choose experimental . Like with the system spec , I will reference myself, user:enu43627 as the user. The system field allows us to define the System this component belongs to, thus we will give it the same value as the metadata.name of our System. Similarly providesApis allows us to define a list of APIs which are exposed by our Backend Component, we will therefore make an entry with what will be the metadata.name of our API my-web-app-rest . Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spec : type : service lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app providesApis : - my-web-app-rest Complete Backend Component Definition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : component metadata : name : my-web-app-backend title : My Web App Backend description : The backend service for My Web App, it magically works without any code spec : type : service lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app providesApis : - my-web-app-rest Create the API \u00b6 We will now create an API exposed by the Backend. We will append the following API definition to the previous definition, with three dashes ( --- ) seperating them. API Entity Definition \u00b6 For an API we must define the entity kind to be API . Thus we will begin the definition with the following: 1 2 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : API API Metadata \u00b6 We will name our backend API my-web-app-rest , give it the title My Web App REST API and an description which will briefly describe what our API exposes. Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 metadata : name : my-web-app-rest title : My Web App Backend description : The REST API for My Web App, it allows you to get lots of useful data API Spec \u00b6 Info A full list of API spec fields can be found in the API spec reference . Each entity must be given a spec, this is unique to each entity kind, and will reside within the spec object. For an API, a type , lifecycle , owner and definition are required, in addition to these we will define a system . Whilst type may be any string there are a small number of commonly used values which should be used, we will choose openapi as this is most appropriate for representing REST APIs. Similarly to the backend component spec we will set the lifecycle to be experimental , the owner to be myself user:enu43627 , and the system as the metadata.name of our System. The API definition should be a multi-line string in the format defined by the type , a minimal OpenAPI definition contains only a few fields and shall be used here, whilst a full definition should be used for real applications where available. Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 spec : type : openapi lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app definition : | openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: My Web App REST API version: 0.0.1 Complete API Definition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : API metadata : name : my-web-app-rest title : My Web App Backend description : The REST API for My Web App, it allows you to get lots of useful data spec : type : openapi lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app definition : | openapi: 3.0.0 info: title: My Web App REST API version: 0.0.1 Create the Frontend Component \u00b6 We will now create a Component for the Frontend. We will append the following Component definition to the previous definition, with three dashes ( --- ) seperating them. Frontend Component Entity Definition \u00b6 For a Component we must define the entity kind to be component . Thus we will begin the definition with the following: 1 2 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : component Frontend Component Metadata \u00b6 We will name our frontend component a my-web-app-frontend , give it the title My Web App Frontend and an description which will briefly describe what our component does. Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 metadata : name : my-web-app-frontend title : My Web App Frontend description : The frontend website for My Web App, it consumes an API and displays data to users Frontend Component Spec \u00b6 Each entity must be given a spec, this is unique to each entity kind , and will reside within the spec object. For a Component, a type , lifecycle , and owner are required, in addition to these we will define system and consumesApis . Whilst type may be any string there are a small number of commonly used values which should be used, we will choose website to describe our Frontend. Similarly to the backend component spec we will set the lifecycle to be experimental , the owner to be myself user:enu43627 , and the system as the metadata.name of our System. Akin to the defining the APIs provided by the backend, we will use consumesApis to define a list of APIs which are called on by our Frontend Component, we will therefore make an entry with what will be the metadata.name of our API my-web-app-rest . Thus we will add the following lines to the definition: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 spec : type : website lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app consumesApis : - my-web-app-rest Complete Frontend Component Definition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 apiVersion : backstage.io/v1alpha1 kind : component metadata : name : my-web-app-backend title : My Web App Backend description : The backend service for My Web App, it magically works without any code spec : type : website lifecycle : experimental owner : user:enu43627 system : my-web-app consumesApis : - my-web-app-rest Save and exit \u00b6 Once complete we can save and exit, to do so in nano press CTRL + X to exit, Y to save and Return to overwrite the opened file.
