In this repository there are editable `svg` files that can be adapted to create an icon, or for other purposes.

Those can be converted into raster graphics [PNG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) which is well-suited for icons.
In addition, you will need a `.ico` file as wel..

In this backstage app the target files you'd want to replace are in the folder `backstage/packages/app/public`. Take not of all six of them:
- android-chrome-192x192.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico 
- safari-pinned-tab.svg

The transformation into the target formats is easy to achieve with image editing software or dedicated CLI utilities.
